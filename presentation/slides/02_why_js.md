### Why immutability (Javascript) ?

>Much of what makes application development difficult is tracking mutation and maintaining state.<!-- .element: style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; font-size: 30px;" -->

>Developing with immutable data encourages you to think differently about how data flows through your application.<!-- .element: style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; font-size: 30px;" -->

>Subscribing to data events throughout your application creates a huge overhead of book-keeping which can hurt performance, sometimes dramatically, and creates opportunities for areas of your application to get out of sync with each other due to easy to make programmer error.<!-- .element: style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; font-size: 30px;" -->

>Since immutable data never changes, subscribing to changes throughout the model is a dead-end and new data can only ever be passed from above.<!-- .element: style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; font-size: 30px;" -->
